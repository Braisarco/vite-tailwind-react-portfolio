                    <span className = "text-4xl font-bold">Hi, my name is Brais, welcome to my Portfolio.</span><br/><br/>
                    <span className = "text-2xl font-semibold">I will start by explaning a little bit of my experience.</span><br/><br/>
                    I'm a last year, student on Computer Science in the university of Ourense. This degree has always been a dream for me, since 
                    I was a little kid i've always wanted to know more about software and hardware and I knew for sure that I would learn as much
                    as I could.<br/><br/>
                    Now that I've been through almost the entire degree I can say that i love technology more than ever. I like hardware, but my 
                    main strenght is without a doubt, programming. I'm a <span className=" text-2xl text-red-700 font-bold">Java</span> lover, but i know a little
                    about <span className=" text-2xl text-blue-500 font-bold">Python </span> , <span className=" text-2xl text-blue-500 font-bold">C++</span> too. Lately I've interested in learning about front end developing.
                    I first learned <span className=" text-2xl text-yellow-500 font-bold">Javascript</span> and more recently I decided to learn how to use different frameworks,
                    such as <span className=" text-2xl text-blue-500 font-bold">React</span> or <span className=" text-2xl text-blue-500 font-bold">Tailwindcss</span>.<br/><br/>

                    I consider myself a person who loves to learn new things, I'm always trying to add new knowledge about every kind of things, not
                    only speaking of computers but also in sports. Im a big sports guy, I've done white water kayaking for 14 years, where i compete
                    at national level. I learned to skate by myself and lately i fell in love with surfing (which is nowadays my favourite thing to do).
                    Doing sports, taught discipline, constant working and dedication. Furthermore I learned how to practice most of them by myself, that 
                    helps me every day on different tasks that i get stuck with.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When speaking about teamwork i think i have the virtue of fitting in almost every place, i use to get along with everyone, and i always
                    will try my best not to let my teamates down. <br/><br/>
                    I worked in a couple different jobs: <br/><br/>
